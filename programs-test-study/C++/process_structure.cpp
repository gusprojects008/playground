child process, but the child is given read-only permission, not write permissions. This and exception called 
"Page fault", the CPU search the IDT for the ISR or handler responsible for handling the exception-type  interrupt.

       Tachnicaly, the pages of the child process have their virtual address, but their physical address points to the
pages of the process. However, the process only has read and not write permissions on them. So, when it tries to write
to them, a "Page fault" exception is triggered, which causes the CPU to trigger the ISR responsible for mapping nd
reserving a physical memory address in RAM for the specific pages. It then updates the page table of the child process
and calls the operation again, allowing the MMU together with the IMC to resolv the physical addressin RAM and write
to the cells elated to them. */
